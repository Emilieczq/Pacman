# Pacman
This a Java project that I did at school about two years ago (in late 2016). It is a classical game: Packman. As I think that I it works not bad, I share all my codes here. You can find all principle codes in the Pacman folder. Or you can just download the zip file and import it in your Eclipse, then you can run it in Eclipse directly.

P.S. The names of classes and some comments are in French.

Here is the demo:

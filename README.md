# Pacman
This a Java project that I realized at school some time ago. It is a classical game project: Packman. As I think that I did it well, I share all my codes here. You can find all principle codes in the Pacman folder. Or you can just download the zip file and open it in your Eclipe, then you can run it in Eclipse.

P.S. The names of classes and some comments are in French.

Here is the demo:
